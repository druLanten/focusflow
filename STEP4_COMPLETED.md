# Step 4: Task Management - COMPLETED ✅

## 🎯 Objective Achieved
Implemented a comprehensive task management system with CRUD operations, categories, priorities, and localStorage persistence.

## ✅ Tasks Completed

### 1. Task Context & State Management
- **TaskContext**: React Context API for centralized task state management
- **Task Reducer**: Comprehensive reducer with actions for all CRUD operations
- **localStorage Integration**: Automatic persistence of tasks to browser storage
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate UI updates when tasks change

### 2. Task Components Architecture
- **Task.js**: Individual task component with inline editing
- **TaskForm.js**: Form component for adding new tasks
- **TaskList.js**: List component with filtering, sorting, and search
- **TaskManagement.js**: Main container component

### 3. CRUD Operations
- ✅ **Create**: Add new tasks with comprehensive form validation
- ✅ **Read**: Display tasks with filtering and sorting options
- ✅ **Update**: Inline editing of all task properties
- ✅ **Delete**: Task deletion with confirmation dialog

### 4. Task Organization Features
- **Categories**: Work, Personal, Health, Learning, Other
- **Priorities**: Low, Medium, High, Urgent (with color coding)
- **Due Dates**: Optional due date setting with overdue detection
- **Pomodoro Estimation**: Estimate and track Pomodoros per task

### 5. Advanced Features
- **Search Functionality**: Real-time search across task names and descriptions
- **Filtering**: Filter by All, Active, Completed tasks
- **Sorting**: Sort by Created Date, Priority, Due Date, Name
- **Task Statistics**: Real-time stats for total, active, completed, overdue tasks
- **Drag & Drop**: Basic drag and drop support for task reordering

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Visual Design
- **Color-Coded Tags**: Different colors for categories and priorities
- **Status Indicators**: Visual indicators for completed, overdue tasks
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout with touch interactions
- **Dark Mode Support**: Full dark mode compatibility

### User Experience

- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Documented shortcuts for power users
- **Empty States**: Helpful messages when no tasks exist
- **Loading States**: Smooth transitions and animations

## 📊 Task Data Structure

```javascript
{
  id: "unique-id",
  name: "Task name",
  description: "Optional description",
  category: "work|personal|health|learning|other",
  priority: "low|medium|high|urgent",
  dueDate: "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z" | null,
  completed: false,
  createdAt: "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  completedAt: "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z" | null,
  pomodorosEstimated: 1,
  pomodorosCompleted: 0
}
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Context API Structure
- **TaskProvider**: Wraps the entire app for global task state
- **useTasks Hook**: Custom hook for accessing task context
- **Reducer Pattern**: Predictable state updates with actions
- **localStorage Sync**: Automatic save/load on state changes

### Component Hierarchy
```
App.js
├── TaskProvider
    ├── TaskManagement.js (Main container)
        ├── TaskForm.js (Add new tasks)
        └── TaskList.js (Display tasks)
            └── Task.js (Individual task items)
```

### State Management Actions
- `LOAD_TASKS` - Load tasks from localStorage
- `ADD_TASK` - Add new task
- `UPDATE_TASK` - Update existing task
- `DELETE_TASK` - Remove task
- `TOGGLE_TASK` - Mark task as complete/incomplete
- `SET_FILTER` - Change task filter
- `SET_SORT` - Change sorting method
- `SET_SEARCH` - Update search query
- `CLEAR_COMPLETED` - Remove all completed tasks

## 🚀 Features in Action

### Task Creation
1. Click "Add New Task" button
2. Fill out comprehensive form with validation
3. Set category, priority, due date, and Pomodoro estimate
4. Task automatically saves to localStorage

### Task Management
1. **View Tasks**: See all tasks with color-coded tags
2. **Edit Tasks**: Click edit icon for inline editing
3. **Complete Tasks**: Click checkbox to mark complete
4. **Delete Tasks**: Click delete icon with confirmation
5. **Search Tasks**: Use search bar for real-time filtering
6. **Filter Tasks**: Switch between All/Active/Completed
7. **Sort Tasks**: Sort by date, priority, due date, or name

### Data Persistence
- All tasks automatically saved to browser localStorage
- Data persists between browser sessions
- No server required - fully offline capable

## 📱 Mobile Experience
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile devices
- **Touch-Friendly**: Large touch targets for mobile interaction
- **Mobile Forms**: Optimized form layouts for small screens
- **Swipe Actions**: Future enhancement for mobile gestures

## 🎯 Next Steps
